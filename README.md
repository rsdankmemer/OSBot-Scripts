# OSBot-Scripts
There are some scripts that I quickly wrote for OSBot.  You will NOT be able to copy/paste and have it working.  This should be used as a reference to write your own scripts and to view how the OSBot API works.


Current List of Scripts:
  1. Auto Enchanter - Start near a bank with required runes/staff and the item you want to enchant in your inventory.  It will automatically detect the item and which spell should be used
